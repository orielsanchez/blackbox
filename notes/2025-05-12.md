# 2025-05-12 – Baseline Strategy Dev Log

## Status
Backtest CLI runs end-to-end on `debug_test.yaml`. Portfolio + execution outputs make sense. Metrics match expected slippage and returns.

## Notes
- Cost model weights likely overpowering signal; tune `impact_coefficient`
- Trades filtered correctly; need diagnostics on `min_notional`
- Risk model allowed full turnover with shorts disabled – likely due to cost override

## TODOs
- Add unit tests for PerformanceMetrics
- Export equity curve to CSV
- Investigate rounding artifacts in notional
