## [2025-05-15] OHLCV Parallel Fetching & High-Throughput Upgrade

### ‚úÖ Completed:
- Rewrote `PolygonOHLCVUpdater` to support threaded per-symbol fetching via `ThreadPoolExecutor`
- Removed rate-limiting logic (`sleep_secs`) to maximize performance on M4 Mac Mini
- Added `max_workers` option to control parallelism
- Batched results and safely inserted via DuckDB
- Updated `fetch_ohlcv.py` CLI to match new interface (removed `sleep_secs`, added `max_workers`)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Config Notes:
- Default lookback = 2 days, refetch = 3 days
- Use `--full-backfill` for 5-year history
- No longer sleeps between batches ‚Äî safe for 90 rps API limits

### üîú Next Steps:
- Add logic to auto-patch missing OHLCV gaps (via integrity check)
- Optionally fallback to `grouped/` endpoint for known problematic tickers
- Consider summary printout of date ranges & symbols processed

## Subject: Fixed Critical Bug in Volatility Calculation for Portfolio Construction

### Issue Summary
When running backtests, I discovered that no trades were being executed despite alpha signals being generated correctly. After extensive debugging, I identified that the portfolio construction model was failing due to an index mismatch in the volatility calculation. The volatility calculation was incorrectly returning dates as the index instead of symbols, resulting in an empty intersection between alpha signals and volatility targets.

### Root Cause
The issue occurred in the `VolatilityScaledPortfolio` class. When using the vectorized approach to calculate historical volatility, it was incorrectly maintaining the MultiIndex structure, causing the level names to be misaligned. Additionally, there were duplicate symbols in the OHLCV data causing the `groupby` operation to fail.

### Solution
1. Reimplemented the volatility calculation to directly target the symbols in alpha signals
2. Added robust error handling and fallbacks when normalization fails
3. Implemented improved symbol matching between alpha signals and volatility calculations
4. Added detailed logging to track the transformation at each step
5. Adjusted strategy parameters for better risk control (reduced risk_target, max_weight)

### Results
The system now successfully executes trades. Over a 180-day backtest period, the strategy showed consistent trading activity. While the performance is negative (returns -73.05%, Sharpe -5.131), this is a strategy parameter issue rather than a system bug.

### Next Steps
1. Refine strategy parameters to improve performance
2. Add more diagnostics for daily P&L tracking
3. Consider alternative signal generation approaches
4. Test with different universe and time periods
