## [2025-05-15] OHLCV Parallel Fetching & High-Throughput Upgrade

### ‚úÖ Completed:
- Rewrote `PolygonOHLCVUpdater` to support threaded per-symbol fetching via `ThreadPoolExecutor`
- Removed rate-limiting logic (`sleep_secs`) to maximize performance on M4 Mac Mini
- Added `max_workers` option to control parallelism
- Batched results and safely inserted via DuckDB
- Updated `fetch_ohlcv.py` CLI to match new interface (removed `sleep_secs`, added `max_workers`)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Config Notes:
- Default lookback = 2 days, refetch = 3 days
- Use `--full-backfill` for 5-year history
- No longer sleeps between batches ‚Äî safe for 90 rps API limits

### üîú Next Steps:
- Add logic to auto-patch missing OHLCV gaps (via integrity check)
- Optionally fallback to `grouped/` endpoint for known problematic tickers
- Consider summary printout of date ranges & symbols processed
