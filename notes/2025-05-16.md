**Feature Area:** Portfolio Model, Risk Constraints, Backtesting Stability

**Changes Made:**

* Refactored and extended `VolatilityScaledPortfolio` to enforce:

  * `max_turnover` constraint via weight scaling
  * `max_trades_per_day` cap using largest notional exposures
* Fixed repeated issues with over-allocation and large trade counts
* Applied defensive fallbacks for:

  * NaN weights
  * Empty volatility
  * All-identical alpha signals (normalization bypassed)
* Ensured consistency of weight clipping, capital allocation, and price filtering
* Rewrote `PositionTracker` to improve:

  * Cost basis updates
  * Holding period enforcement
  * Trade recording and execution accounting
* Added better logging to debug weight generation, turnover control, and filter rejections
* Re-tested config using:

  * EWMA volatility risk model
  * Mean reversion alpha
  * Fixed + slippage execution
* Validated that edge cases (e.g., no tradable symbols, flat signals) now gracefully degrade with warning
* Ran full backtest (271 days) with improved drawdown control and turnover enforcement
* Observed improved Sharpe (‚Üí 0.16), tighter drawdown (max \~0.24%), and high compliance with constraints
