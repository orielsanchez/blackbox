### üß© Focus Area:

Debugging `MeanReversionAlphaModel` signal output and ensuring proper feature engineering pipeline.

---

### ‚úÖ Work Done:

1. **Added Features:**

   * Implemented and registered two key feature generators:

     * `zscore_price` with rolling window.
     * `bollinger_band` with normalization.
   * Passed them to the alpha model via the config.

2. **Fixed `FeatureMatrixGenerator`:**

   * Ensured daily feature DataFrames use symbols as the index.
   * Guaranteed clean vertical concatenation into a full multi-index DataFrame.

3. **Improved `MeanReversionAlphaModel`:**

   * Validated required columns exist (`zscore_{window}d`, `bollinger_norm_{window}`).
   * Flattened index to symbol-level for scoring.
   * Applied `.fillna(0)` and filtered out duplicate symbols.
   * Sorted and returned clean Series.

4. **Ran full backtests:**

   * Alpha model now returns **clean**, deduplicated outputs.
   * However, scores are **all zero**, suggesting feature values may be flat or missing.
   * Portfolio is still constructing positions ‚Äî likely default logic from portfolio model in absence of alpha guidance.

5. **Next step identified:**

   * Print or inspect values from `feature_matrix.loc[date]` in alpha model.
   * Use `.describe()` or `.head()` to check if features are `NaN`, all zeros, or improperly scaled.
