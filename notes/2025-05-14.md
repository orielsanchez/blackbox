### 🧠 Dev Log — *2025-05-14*

**Branch:** `feature/feature/engineering`
**Focus:** Feature Engineering, Validation, Alpha Integration, Backtesting, Metrics

---

#### ✅ What Was Completed:

* **🔧 Feature Pipeline:**

  * Fixed issues with `FeatureMatrixGenerator.run()` logic and performance on rolling data.
  * Updated `FeaturePipeline` to properly handle NaNs and enforce per-feature validation.
  * Added centralized feature validation logic to warn or fail on malformed feature vectors.

* **🧠 Alpha Models:**

  * Cleaned up logic in `mean_reversion` model.
  * Ensured all alpha models now dynamically pull features from `snapshot['feature_vector']`.
  * Validated compatibility with feature spec generation and composite interface.

* **📈 Metrics:**

  * Rewrote `PerformanceMetrics` with:

    * Total Return
    * Annualized Return/Volatility
    * Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar Ratios
    * Max Drawdown
    * Start/End Equity
  * Added optional return of equity curve for visualization or export.

* **📊 Backtest Infrastructure:**

  * Updated `BacktestEngine` to integrate improved `PerformanceMetrics` and handle `initial_equity`.
  * Fixed `PositionTracker` logic for trade filtering and updating based on entry date.
  * Rewrote `run_backtest()` CLI handler to:

    * Use cached feature matrix if available
    * Correctly load `initial_equity` from YAML config
    * Trim features and simulate on consistent data range
    * Save `history.pkl`, `history.csv`, and `metrics.json` to run directory.

### 🗓️ TODO — *Tomorrow (2025-05-15)*

1. **\[ ] Add equity curve plot output (`equity.png`) and optionally drawdowns.**
2. **\[ ] Add CSV export of alpha signals and trades for diagnostic review.**
3. **\[ ] Benchmark comparison support (e.g. SPY buy-and-hold or equal-weighted universe).**
4. **\[ ] Validate behavior of position tracking on re-entry / early exits.**
5. **\[ ] Review logging structure for trade execution and holding period violations.**
6. **\[ ] Write unit tests for FeaturePipeline and AlphaModel base interfaces.**
